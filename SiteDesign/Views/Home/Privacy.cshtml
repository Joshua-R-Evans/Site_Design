    <p>Your inquiry into our privacy policy has made this kitten suspicious. Very suspicious. It is now watching your every move like the thousands of years of evolution that turned it into the vicious killing machine that it is, happened just to stop you from doing anything malicious. Fear the kitten, fear Mittens.</p>
